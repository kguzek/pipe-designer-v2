# Pipe Designer V2

This is a web app built for an ad hoc proof-of-concept. It allows the user to place rudimentary 'pipe' pieces on an expanding grid plane, implementing logic that disallows illegal connections. The page is mouse-operated, however there are two keyboard events mapped to the entire document:

## R
This rotates the currently selected pipe element (if any) 90 degrees clockwise.

## Shift+R
This rotates the currently selected pipe element (if any) 90 degrees anticlockwise.
